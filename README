Prerequisites:
	-Instructions below are intended for use on Macs, some commands may be different on other types of computers.

		-To check this, go to terminal and type "python3 --version" 
		-If it's not downloaded, use the link below
			-https://www.python.org/downloads/
	-Download the OPML package 
		-Info here: https://pypi.org/project/opml/
		-OPML is the package that dynalist uses to format data, so there is no getting around downloading this package.
		-To download, type "pip install opml" into terminal
			-If pip is not installed on your computer...
				-Type this command into terminal "sudo easy_install pip"
			-If you get weird opml errors later in the process...
				-Try using "pip3" instead of "pip" to install opml
				-You might need to upgrade pip
					-Pip is now on version 20.x, so make sure yours is at least close
						-Version can be checked with "pip --version"
					-Use the command "pip install -U pip" in terminal to upgrade your version
